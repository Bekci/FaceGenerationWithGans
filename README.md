# FaceGenerationWithGans
This repository includes the term project files of the Computer Vision course. 

In the project,  generating fake faces using BGAN & DCGAN architectures was the main goal. After these achieved, fake face images tried to be classified.

Analysis of cross dataset and methodology performances of the classifiers reported.
